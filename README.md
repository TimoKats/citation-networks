## &#128270; Citation Networks in Journalism

### Abstract
This project shows a network graph that aims to visualize the supply chain of journalism, which refers to the citation and reproduction of news articles. It does this through displaying a directional network graph (based on data from Google News). In this graph, the nodes refer to news sources and the edges refer to citations. Note, an outgoing edge means a news source *got* cited and vise-versa.

### Set up
The app runs in Flask from your terminal. So, if you have Python 3 installed simply run `pip install requirements.txt` and `python3 main.py`. After this, the app should run on `127.0.0.1:5000`.
